# jackdesmond.me (out of date - see jackdesmond.dev

Purpose:

Serves a personal website hosting my resume and an about me section.

About the Website:

I used HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript to build this website. Some of its features include smooth scroll from the navigation bar links to each section of the page using jQuery and responseness to mobile devices.

Future Plans:

In the future, I will continue to build out this website and evetually transition it into my developer portfolio site. It will feature all the projects I have worked on in the past.
